# Games
This repository features two classic games, Snake and Tic-Tac-Toe, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Snake challenges players to navigate and grow a snake, testing reflexes and strategy, while Tic-Tac-Toe offers an intuitive 2-player experience on a 3x3 grid. Both games are responsive, nostalgic, and perfect for learning interactive web development.
